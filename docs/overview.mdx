# What is Unforgettable?

**TL;DR:** Unforgettable uses account abstraction and visual keys to manage EVM wallets, so you never have to store or remember seed phrases.

## Why Unforgettable?

- **No seed phrases:** Users authenticate leveraging visual memory (their face, a favorite object, etc.) instead of managing 12–24‑word phrases.
- **Self-custodial and private:** The cryptographic secret is re-derived on the client device; only a public key and additional helping data are stored in the blockchain or on the app server. Raw biometrics or key material never leave the device.
- **Multi‑factor auth:** Combine visuals (e.g., face + object), location and add a short password or proof‑of‑work (PoW) step to reach the full 112‑bit security target.
- **Smooth onboarding:** First‑time users set up in seconds. Ideal for dApps that target mainstream audiences.
- **Phishing‑resistant:** There is nothing to type or copy, eliminating most social‑engineering vectors.

## Tech overview

Unforgettable relies on a novel cryptographic primitive called *fuzzy extractors*, which convert “noisy” biometric/visual data into a stable, private key that can be reproduced from a close‑enough reading of the same object. Security is layered by combining factors (e.g., face + object) and strengthened further with a password or a proof-of-work challenge.

### Security assumptions

To achieve a 112‑bit security baseline, Unforgettable fuses ≈46 bits of entropy extracted from a face‑plus‑object pair with an additional 66 bits contributed by either a short password alone or a shorter password reinforced by an optional 2¹⁶‑space proof‑of‑work challenge.

| Factor            | Entropy usable today | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Face              | ≈14-20 bits             | FAR ≈ 2⁻²⁰–2⁻²¹ |
| Generic object    | ≈40 bits             | Image distinguishing points |
| Location          | Up to 40 bits        | 10-meter range accuracy required |
| Face + object     | ≈54 bits             | Independent sources add up |
| Password          | ≈49 bits (8 chars) | ~6.12 bits per printable ASCII char |
| PoW Challenge     | ≈6 bits             | 2⁶ space |
| **Total**         | ≈112 bits           | ≥112-bit baseline satisfied |

Further improvements are being researched:

- **Model upgrades:** Moving to 512‑D face embeddings and “specific‑object” extractors is expected to yield 40-60 bits per object and ≥ 70 bits from a face + object pair.
- **Shorter secrets:** With 70 visual bits, the password can drop to 7 random characters, or 5 with the same PoW range, while preserving 112‑bit security.
- **New modalities:** Voice prints, 3-D scans and other high‑entropy sources are being researched to reduce user effort further.

### Registration and recovery flows

To set up an Unforgettable smart-contract wallet we need to:

1. Create a standard externally owned account (EOA).
2. Delegate the EOA to the Unforgettable smart contract via a type‑4 *set‑code* transaction.
3. Pay the annual subscription fee to the Subscription contract.
4. Grant the Unforgettable contract permission to use the private key derived from Unforgettable’s security challenges.

Once the smart-contract wallet is ready, all the user needs to do to restore access to it is:

- Make sure the annual fee was paid;
- Derive the Unforgettable private key from the security challenges;

## User flow

Example of Unforgettable flow is shown in the demo below:

## Subscription

The subscription is activated at setup, but the fee can be only charged when you actually invoke the recovery flow.

## Comparison with other wallet approaches

Unforgettable fits into the “smart account + just‑in‑time key derivation” category. Below is a practical comparison against common alternatives.

| Dimension | MPC wallet | Smart account + MPC signer | Smart account + passkeys (WebAuthn) | Unforgettable (smart account + fuzzy extractor) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Key is split into shares; multiple parties/devices must co-sign each transaction | Funds in a smart-contract wallet; multiple parties/devices must co-sign each transaction | Funds in a smart-contract wallet; authorization uses passkeys/WebAuthn-derived signing keys | Funds in a smart-contract wallet; signing key is derived on demand from biometrics/visual keys/location via fuzzy extractor (JIT keys) |
| **Self-custody / regulatory risk** | **Medium–High** (signers can be seen as custodians) | **Medium–High** (signers can be seen as custodians) | **Low–Medium** (platform doesn’t control the key, but “soft custody” concerns may exist depending on the passkey provider model) | **Low** (user is the end key owner; platform never holds end keys/shares, only helper + policy metadata) |
| **Key storage & risk** | **Medium–High**: shares stored on MPC provider infra (often in TEE). Risks: collusion, DoS | **Medium–High**: shares stored on MPC provider infra (often in TEE). Risks: collusion, DoS | **Low–Medium**: key stored on device; optionally synced. Risks: device loss/theft; ecosystem DoS/collusion if synced | **Low–Medium**: no end-key storage (JIT). Risks: spoofing attempts; platform availability/DoS |
| **Recovery** | Depends on MPC providers | Depends on MPC providers | Device control (for local keys); if cloud-synced, relies on provider liveness | Relies on deterministic re-derivation; optional on-chain guardians/timelocks as safety nets |
| **Cost assumptions** | Platform fee + per-signing/per-wallet costs; expensive at consumer scale | Platform fee + per-signing/per-wallet costs; expensive at consumer scale | Smart-account gas + bundler/paymaster ops; generally cheaper than MPC | Smart-account gas + bundler/paymaster ops + small helper-data storage; generally cheaper than MPC |
| **Interoperability** | **High**: most dApps work out of the box | **Medium**: needs bundler/paymaster; usually per-chain deployments/modules | **Medium**: needs bundler/paymaster; usually per-chain deployments/modules | **High**: can produce standard keys/signatures and/or use smart-account policies; easier multi-chain (smart-account deployments still need bundler/paymaster infra) |
| **Portability** | **Medium**: broad device/OS support, but hard to migrate | **Medium**: broad device/OS support, but hard to migrate | **Low–Medium**: often hard/impossible to switch passkey provider or attach passkeys to a different account | **Medium–High**: re-derive on any device; optional advanced export; avoids cloud lock-in |
| **Sanctions / screening / abuse controls** | **High**: centralized controls (screening/limits), can increase custody-like perception | **High**: centralized controls (screening/limits), can increase custody-like perception | **Medium**: on-chain allowlists possible; depends on whether users can transact outside the app | **Medium–High**: screen at initiation; smart-account rules can enforce on-chain limits/allowlists while remaining non-custodial |

\* For smart-account approaches, availability/DoS risk can be reduced with extended on-chain emergency recovery functions (e.g., locktimes, guardians/social recovery).

Key takeaways:

- **MPC-based approaches** can feel seamless, but introduce higher custody/regulatory risk (signers can be viewed as custodians) and higher costs at consumer scale.
- **Passkey-based smart accounts** reduce custody risk, but often trade off portability (provider/device lock-in) and can inherit ecosystem availability/DoS risks.
- **Unforgettable** avoids storing end keys (keys are derived on demand) and aims for low custody risk, with optional on-chain safety nets (e.g., guardians/timelocks) where needed.


## Conclusion

Unforgettable offers an alternative to seed phrases with visual keys derived via fuzzy extractors, combining factors (face + object) with a short password and a PoW  challenge to reach a ≥ 112-bit security baseline without exposing biometric data. Built on account abstraction, it enables fast onboarding and straightforward recovery of EVM smart-contract wallets while remaining self-custodial, private and phishing-resistant.

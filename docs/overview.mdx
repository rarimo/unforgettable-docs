# What is Unforgettable Recovery?

**TL;DR:** Unforgettable Recovery uses account abstraction and visual keys to manage EVM wallets, so you never have to store or remember seed phrases.

## Why Unforgettable Recovery?

- **No seed phrases:** Users authenticate leveraging visual memory (their face, a favorite object, etc.) instead of managing 12–24‑word phrases.
- **Self-custodial and private:** The cryptographic secret is re-derived on the client device; only a public key and additional helping data are stored in the blockchain or on the app server. Raw biometrics or key material never leave the device.
- **Multi‑factor auth:** Combine visuals (e.g., face + object) and add a short password or proof‑of‑work (PoW) step to reach the full 112‑bit security target.
- **Smooth onboarding:** First‑time users set up in seconds. Ideal for dApps that target mainstream audiences.
- **Phishing‑resistant:** There is nothing to type or copy, eliminating most social‑engineering vectors.

## Tech overview

Unforgettable Recovery relies on a novel cryptographic primitive called **fuzzy extractors**, which convert “noisy” biometric/visual data into a stable, private key that can be reproduced from a close‑enough reading of the same object. Security is layered by combining factors (e.g., face + object) and strengthened further with a password or a proof-of-work challenge.

### Security assumptions

To achieve a 112‑bit security baseline, Unforgettable fuses ≈46 bits of entropy extracted from a face‑plus‑object pair with an additional 66 bits contributed by either a short password alone or a shorter password reinforced by an optional 2¹⁶‑space proof‑of‑work challenge.

| Factors | Entropy usable today |

| Factor            | Entropy usable today | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Face              | ≈14-20 bits             | FAR ≈ 2⁻²⁰–2⁻²¹ |
| Generic object    | ≈40 bits             | Image distinguishing points |
| Face + object     | ≈54 bits             | Independent sources add up |
| Password          | ≈49 bits (8 chars) | ~6.12 bits per printable ASCII char |
| PoW Challenge     | ≈6 bits             | 2⁶ space |
| **Total**         | ≈112 bits           | ≥112-bit baseline satisfied |

Further improvements are being researched:

- **Model upgrades:** Moving to 512‑D face embeddings and “specific‑object” extractors is expected to yield 40-60 bits per object and ≥ 70 bits from a face + object pair.
- **Shorter secrets:** With 70 visual bits, the password can drop to 7 random characters, or 5 with the same PoW range, while preserving 112‑bit security.
- **New modalities:** Voice prints, 3-D scans and other high‑entropy sources are being researched to reduce user effort further.

### Registration and recovery flows

To set up an Unforgettable smart-contract wallet we need to:

1. Create a standard externally owned account (EOA).
2. Delegate the EOA to the Unforgettable smart contract via a type‑4 *set‑code* transaction.
3. Pay the annual subscription fee to the Subscription contract.
4. Grant the Unforgettable contract permission to use the private key derived from Unforgettable’s security challenges.

Once the smart-contract wallet is ready, all the user needs to do to restore access to it is:

- Make sure the annual fee was paid;
- Derive the Unforgettable private key from the security challenges;

## Subscription

The subscription is activated at setup, but the fee can be only charged when you actually invoke the recovery flow.

## Conclusion

Unforgettable Recovery offers an alternative to seed phrases with visual keys derived via fuzzy extractors, combining factors (face + object) with a short password and a PoW  challenge to reach a ≥ 112-bit security baseline without exposing biometric data. Built on account abstraction, it enables fast onboarding and straightforward recovery of EVM smart-contract wallets while remaining self-custodial, private and phishing-resistant.

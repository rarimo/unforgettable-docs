# Integrating Unforgettable Recovery into your wallet

:::info
Unforgettable is working on an SDK for smart-contract wallets to easily integrate recovery features. If you are a wallet developer interested in integrating Unforgettable Recovery, please reach out to us on <OutLink href= "https://t.me/+pWugh5xgDiE3Y2Jk">Telegram</OutLink>.
:::

The main components of the SDK will include:

- Unforgettable DApp responsible for collecting user data and managing recovery processes. It can be integrated into your wallet as a webview or a separate app.
- Smart-contracts that can be integrated into your wallet's smart-contract codebase. These contracts will handle interactions with the Unforgettable DApp and manage recovery logic.

On the smart-contract level, the sign up and recovery flows will look like this:

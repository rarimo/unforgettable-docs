A Smart Account is the on-chain smart-contract wallet used by Unforgettable Embedded Wallets. It holds user assets and enforces programmable rules on-chain and is controlled by the Unforgettable Key.

The Smart Account supports account abstraction patterns such as gasless (sponsored) transactions, batched execution, and custom validation logic via ERC-4337.

## Action authorization flow

At a high level, an action is executed only when all required checks pass:

1. Unforgettable Key authorizes the action (user’s primary control). Authorization can happen by deriving the key on demand, or (if enabled) by using a passkey as a fast confirmation path without re-running the full derivation flow.
2. Policy Engine approves it (rules, limits, recovery constraints).

## Passkeys

Smart Accounts support passkeys (WebAuthn/FIDO2) as a convenience for confirming actions. A passkey enables fast, OS-native approval on a trusted device, avoiding repeated Unforgettable Key derivation for common flows such as small transfers.

Passkeys never replace the Unforgettable Key: they are only a shortcut for confirmation. Any action approved with a passkey can always be completed by deriving the Unforgettable Key instead, which remains the primary authority. If a passkey is unavailable, the user proceeds via Unforgettable Key derivation without loss of functionality.

Passkeys (WebAuthn/FIDO2) provide a phishing-resistant way to confirm high-impact actions inside embedded wallet flows.

## What passkeys are used for

Use passkeys to protect actions that are dangerous if clicked through accidentally or under social pressure:

- Confirming large transfers as dictated by the Policy Engine.
- Enabling recovery mechanisms.
- Rotating recovery parameters (timelock duration, recovery destination, guardian set, thresholds).
- Generating / re-generating a fallback recovery artifact.

## Example: confirming fallback recovery setup

A common pattern (mirroring the UI flow in the reference design) is:

1. Wallet is created.
2. User is prompted to set up fallback recovery.
3. The app explains what will happen:
   - The user signs a recovery transaction that is not submitted now.
   - The transaction is stored off-chain for a limited validity window (e.g., 90 days).
   - It can only be used after a manual identity check.
4. User reviews the summary (“from wallet → recovery destination”, “all funds”, “not submitted now”).
5. User confirms via passkey.

:::note
Treat passkey confirmation as “breaking-glass UX.” If the action can eventually move all funds (even after a delay), it should require a strong confirmation step.

## UX guidelines

- **Explain the consequences in plain language.** If a fallback transaction could transfer *all funds*, say so.
- **Show timing constraints clearly.** Timelock duration, validity window, and renewal reminders.
- **Require user acknowledgment** (checkbox) before the passkey prompt.
- Prefer “Confirm using passkey” to generic “Continue.”
